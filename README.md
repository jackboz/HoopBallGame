# Hoopball

The second game of my challenge: to make games in a week. I select a successful, presumably simple, game and try to reimplement it as much as I can within a week.

# Controls

A and D for one player. A,D and arrows for two players. The goal is to score 5 hits first.

In TWO HANDS mode, a player controls two rings simultaneously to aim for a time record.

Soon I'm going to pick the next game.

# Notes

The reference game is [Hoop Stars](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.highcore.hoopstars).

The trickiest part was understanding how to create a rigidbody with holes in Unity.

Feel free to educate me. Leave any questions, comments, suggestions, or improvements on the code and the game itself.
